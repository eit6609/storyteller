        p.first Welcome to the #[em Desert Traversal] game!
        p.
            You are at the edge of the desert and you must reach your base at the opposite edge of it. That is, you have
            to cross the desert.
        p.
            You have a motorbike that can carry #{state.getConfig().loadCapacity} jerrycan(s) of fuel, and the tank
            can be filled up with #{state.getConfig().tankCapacity} jerrycan(s).
        p.
            Along the way you can stop in #{state.getConfig().locations} locations. This number is determined by
            the distance that you can go with a full tank. That is, going from a location to the next or the previous
            one consumes #{state.getConfig().consumption} jerrycan(s) of fuel.
        p Your starting location has #{state.getConfig().cans} jerrycan(s).
        p Ready? click #[a(href=goto('location')) here] to start.
