Welcome to the *Saving Goat and Cabbages* game!

Your mission is to carry a goat, a cabbage and a wolf across a river.

You have a boat, but it's little and it can bring only one object besides you.

But be careful not to leave the goat alone with the cabbage on a bank: the goat would eat the cabbage!

And also be careful not to leave the wolf alone with the goat on a bank: the wolf would eat the goat!

Ready? clic [here](`goto('bank0')`) to begin.
