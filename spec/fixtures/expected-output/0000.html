    <h3>The Tower of Hanoi</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p></p>
    <p class="firstOfChapter">Welcome to the <em>Tower of Hanoi</em> game!</p>
    <p>In this game there are three pegs, numbered from 1 to 3, and 4 disks,
      numbered from 1 to 4. The bigger the number, the bigger the disk.
    </p>
    <p>At the beginning, all the disks are stacked on peg 1, with decreasing diameters from the bottom to the top.</p>
    <p>Graphically, the situation is shown like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Peg 1: (4 3 2 1)</li>
      <li>Peg 2: ()</li>
      <li>Peg 3: ()</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="first">That is, the stacks are shown with the bottom to the left and the top to the right.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to move all the stack from peg 1 to peg 3, following these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can move only one disk at a time, from the top of a stack to the top of another.</li>
      <li>You can put a disk only on an empty stack or on a bigger disk.</li>
    </ul>
